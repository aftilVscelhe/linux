Monster Hunter Generations is a popular action role-playing game for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS. It features a huge variety of monsters, weapons, armor, quests, and locations to explore. If you want to save your progress and transfer it to another device, or if you want to use a save file from another player, you will need to use a save editing tool and a custom firmware (CFW) on your Switch or 3DS.

In this article, we will show you how to download and use Monster Hunter Generations save files from different sources. We will also provide some links to reliable and safe websites where you can find save files with different features and progress.
 
## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
 
- A Nintendo Switch or Nintendo 3DS with CFW installed. CFW allows you to run homebrew applications and modify your system. If you don't have CFW, you can follow this guide for Switch or this guide for 3DS.
- A microSD card with enough space to store your save files.
- A PC with a microSD card reader or a USB cable to connect your device to your PC.
- A save editing tool for Monster Hunter Generations. We recommend using APM MHX/MHGen Save Editor[^3^], which works for both Monster Hunter X and Monster Hunter Generations. You can download it from here[^3^].
- A backup of your original save file. This is important in case something goes wrong or you want to restore your original progress. You can use Checkpoint[^2^], a homebrew application that lets you backup and restore save files for Switch and 3DS games. You can download it from here[^2^].
- A save file that you want to use. You can find many save files online with different features and progress. For example, you can download a save file with 100% game completion[^2^], or a save file with all DLC and MHG transfer bonus[^1^]. Make sure the save file is compatible with your game region and version.
